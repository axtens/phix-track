# Learning

Phix has a wide variety of resources to help both experienced programmers and beginners.

 * The distribution includes an extensive manual in docs\phix\phix.chm which is also available [online][documentation]. Linux users may prefer to
    run docs\phix\makephix.exw which should populate docs\phix\html, and then start with docs\phix\html\phix.htm
 * The distribution includes over 500 demo programs, some of which are quite advanced.
 * There are 1674 and counting entries for Phix on [RosettaCode][rosettacode].
 * There is a slightly saner curated list of 123 entries [here][basic] which may be a better place to start.
 * There is an admittedly often past their best and somewhat less useful archive of 2160+ entries in [PCAN][pcan].
 * Lastly, questions, suggestions, and general chat about Phix are welcome on the [Euphoria forum][forum].

Phix is closely related to Euphoria, although their implementations share not one line of code, at least that is if you ignore the handful of
written-in-Phix and written-in-Euphoria standard library components. The [learning resources for that][eul] may also be helpful.
